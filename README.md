# Welcome to the Ithaca AIWG Beginner Project Github!

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to gain expirence with popular data science libraries and data science concepts. We will be building a working information retervial system that will produce a ranked list of documents given a search query. By doing so we will cover topics in data mining, natural language processing and machine learning. 

The project is broken into the following parts:

1. Text pre-processing
2. Web scraping
3. Boolean retrevial
4. Ranked retrevial
5. Evaluation
6. TBD

Participants are welcome to work at their own pace however we will also be working on and discussing each part of the project at the AIWG meetings.

The tenative schedule for AIWG group work is the following:

1. Text pre-processing & web scraping (1/25/18)
2. Boolean retrevial & ranked retervial (3/29/18)
3. Evaluation & TBD (5/31/18)

These dates are subject to change given the pace the AIWG works through the material.
Part 6 will be decided based on group intrest in the areas of ML, NLP and IR.
